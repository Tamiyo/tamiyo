### Greetings!

Hi there, I'm Matthew! I'm a programming languages / compiler hobbiest and a machine learning practitioner currently working fulltime as a software engineer. I love to explore new and interesting tech, and you'll probably see me dabble in a lot of compiler and ml related projects on my profile. I'm primarily interested in exploring Rust and C programming at the moment, but I also dabble in Python and sometimes Dart.
