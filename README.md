### Greetings!
Hi there, I'm Matthew! I'm a compiler hobbyist and machine learning practitioner currently working fulltime as a software engineer. I love to explore new and interesting tech, and you'll probably see me dabble in a lot of compiler and machine-learning related projects on my profile.  I'm primarily exploring Rust and C programming at the moment, but I also dabble in Python and sometimes Dart.
